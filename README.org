#+title: Anxiety for .tex files

This is a tool for writing reviewer response letters and making sure that the
quotes are consistent between the paper text and the letter. Sometimes, =anxiety= helps a little.

As of now, it is just a proof of concept.

* Usage:
- in the =.tex= file(s), mark the blocks that you want to remain consistent with
  the comment lines, as follows:

  #+begin_quote
 % begin quote q1
  (your text here)

 % end quote q1
  #+end_quote

  Then, if two such blocks appear across the input files, they will be =diff=-ed,
  and the changes must be highlighted in the program output.

- To check consistency just feed the filenames to the tool as inputs, e.g.:

  #+begin_src bash
$ python -m anxiety tests/*.tex
  #+end_src


Example: see [[./tests/file1.tex]] (an "original text" file) and [[./tests/letter.tex]]
(a "letter with quotes"). To test the program:

  #+begin_src bash
$ python -m anxiety tests/file1.tex tests/letter.tex
  #+end_src
